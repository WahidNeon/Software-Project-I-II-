The purpose of this project is to implement such an automatic system that uses smartphones to detect vehicle accidents and report it to the closest available responders to assist in reducing the number of deaths in victims of vehicular accidents. The detection system would help reduce fatalities because of vehicle accidents by decreasing the inevitable delay between an occurrence of an accident and the emergency responders being informed. The system also will provide victim information to emergency services like the Local Police department as well as Medical emergency services. In this project, we are utilizing the several sensor functionalities built into most common android smartphones to detect accidents and report it to the closest available emergency responders with the location of victims. On an emergency responder side, the system will inform responders about the incidents that occur close to them and provide them with real time tracking of emergency victims on a map. This can help emergency responders keep track of the victim's location and rescue them as soon as possible.
